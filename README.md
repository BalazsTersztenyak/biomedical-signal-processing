TODO: requirements.txt

## Task 1
It was a presentation about a chosen device or application. We had to introduce the device, the technology they use and the relevancy.

## Task 2
We had to download a dataset of biomedical signals. Then we had to load the data using Python, get familiar with the data and make some visualizations. After that we had to do some basic frequency based analysis using FFT.

## Task 3
We had to select a particular biomedical signal and show how it changes due to normal physiological changes like breathing, stress or excercise.
